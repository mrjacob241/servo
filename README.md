# Homepage/Search Engine system for Servo (Demo Code)

⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS! ⚠️

I created this fork to implement in Servo the options "homepage-url" and "searchpage-url". This option could be relevant in terms of European Digital Market Act (DMA), because DMA states that the user should be able to choose its favourite search engine freely. The search engines currently supported by Servo are: DuckDuckGo (default) and Ecosia.

Servo is a prototype web browser engine written in the
[Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) language. It is currently developed on
64-bit macOS, 64-bit Linux, 64-bit Windows, 64-bit OpenHarmony, and Android.

I recomend the original documentation (Servo Browser, Linux Foundation Europe):

- The [Servo Book](https://book.servo.org) for documentation
- [servo.org](https://servo.org/) for news and guides
